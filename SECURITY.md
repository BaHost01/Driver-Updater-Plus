1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose:**  
   Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly (e.g., through a GitHub issue or forum post) until we have had the opportunity to resolve the issue. Responsible disclosure helps protect all users.

2. **Contact Us Securely:**

## Our Security Commitment

- **Prompt Response:**  
  Our team will review all vulnerability reports as soon as possible and work on a fix. Once the issue has been addressed, we will release a patch and publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability after a reasonable period to allow users to upgrade.

  We respect your privacy and will treat all security reports confidentially until a fix is available.
